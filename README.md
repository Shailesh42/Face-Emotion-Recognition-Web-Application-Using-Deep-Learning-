# Face Emotion Recognition Web Application ReadMe

## Introduction

Welcome to the Face Emotion Recognition Web Application! This application utilizes deep learning techniques and the FER2013 dataset from Kaggle to recognize and classify facial emotions. Users can upload images containing human faces and the application will predict the dominant emotion expressed in each face.

## Features

- Upload an image: Users can upload an image containing one or more human faces for emotion recognition.
- Emotion prediction: The application employs a deep learning model to predict the primary emotion displayed in the uploaded image.
- User-friendly interface: The web interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Quick response: Emotion predictions are processed promptly, providing users with fast results.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Face Emotion Recognition Web Application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/face-emotion-recognition.git](https://github.com/Shailesh42/Face-Emotion-Recognition-Web-Application-Using-Deep-Learning-.git)
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd face-emotion-recognition
   ```

3. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Download the FER2013 dataset from Kaggle and extract the images into a directory named `datasets`. The dataset should have the following structure:

   ```
   datasets/
   ├── fer2013/
       ├── fer2013.csv
       ├── train/
       ├── test/
   ```

2. Train the deep learning model using the `train_model.py` script:

   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```

   This script will preprocess the data, train the model, and save it for later use.

3. Once the model is trained, start the Flask web application:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will provide a local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`). Open this URL in your web browser.

4. Upload an image containing a human face using the interface and click the "Predict" button. The application will display the predicted emotion for each detected face in the image.

## Model Details

The deep learning model is trained using the FER2013 dataset, which contains labeled facial emotion images. The model architecture is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), designed to recognize facial features and patterns associated with different emotions. The trained model is then used for predicting emotions in new images.

## Acknowledgments

- The FER2013 dataset is used in this project. You can find more information about the dataset on Kaggle: [FER2013 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)
- The Flask web framework is employed to create the user interface and handle image uploads.
- Deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras are used for building and training the emotion recognition model.

## Limitations

- The accuracy of emotion recognition may vary based on image quality, lighting conditions, and other factors.
- The model's performance might not generalize well to certain demographic groups or less common facial expressions.
